## Project Title: Development of machine learning model integrating transcriptional and biological interaction data to predict non-small cell lung cancer using LASSO. 

### Motivation: This repository contains all information to develope a LASSO model for predicting Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

An easily accessible [shiny webserver](https://hifzuransari.shinyapps.io/NSCLCpred/) is also develope for predicting your dataset.
